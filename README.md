# BaxterHello_V-REP
Simulated Baxter Robot writing "hello"

This is a simple simulation I did using the V-REP simulator:
http://www.coppeliarobotics.com/

In this simulation I use an external Python script to control the position of a pen and make the simulated Baxter robot write the word "hello".  

A video from this simulation is available here:
